## Usage & Example
* ```ebAlert links [opts] ``` to show, add, remove links
* ```ebAlert links --help ``` to get list of options for the links
  
* ```ebAlert start``` to start receiving notification


* ```ebAlert links -a "https://www.ebay...k0l9354r20"```  This assumes that you just had a look through the web page already, so no notification will be send. 
* Typically, this would be run as a cron job on an hourly basis.

## Requirements
* A telegram bot API token and your personal conversation id
* Python 3
* click, requests, bs4 and sqlalchemy (arguably sqlalchemy is a little overkill for that purpose)
